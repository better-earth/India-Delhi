# India-Delhi

## Why

This repo is part of the [**Better Earth**](https://github.com/better-earth) organization which I have created to implement a concept I had in mind - we could use Github to involve programmers/developers/coders to make earth a better place just as an open source project does.

The idea is to use Github issues and pull requests to discuss, suggest and track solutions to various issues that the people of Earth face today. For the same, each state can be repository with the name `{Country}-{State}`.

## How

As an example, I have created an [issue on *Pollution*](https://github.com/better-earth/India-Delhi/issues/1) and how we can use [pull requests](https://github.com/better-earth/India-Delhi/pull/2) to solve such issues with the help of involvement from Government & similar bodies/organizations.

I am not sure if this will work or not, but I think the Github community can certainly help coming up with solid ideas that many people can take ahead and implement.
I welcome [comments & suggestions from everyone](https://github.com/better-earth/India-Delhi/issues/3) on what they think about this concept.
